# Chatbot 
This repo contains the back end of **Weatherbot**, a chat bot I created to practice integration of AI agents and tool use. Currently it only gets the weather for a location using [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/) API, hence the name. 

**Weatherbot** is also currently active and hosted on Google Cloud, drop me a mail if you wish to try it out.

I am currently prototyping new features for the bot, so stay tuned!
